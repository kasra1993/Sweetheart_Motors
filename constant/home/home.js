    description: `Small lot filled with quality used vehicles that are reasonably priced.
    We bought a Toyota Sienna from Motorland for my mother and this is by far the best experience we have had buying a used vehicle and we have bought many throughout the years. The service was excellent both before and after purchase and the owner is a personable young man and he knows his business very well. Can't say enough good things about the place.
    We'll buy there again when replacing our car.Thanks again!`,

      Would highly recommend this place to everyone.`,

    description: `It was an amazing experience dealing with Motorland especially Faysal who does a great job. The highly professional way and the wonderful smile make you feel secured to buy a car from a credible dealer. They promised me to bring the car back in 3 days for polishing and this shows the way they have commitment toward their customers.
    Thank you very much.
